What's cozy-template?
---------------------

This repository is a client-side app skeleton for Cozy Cloud<sup>v3</sup>. We keep it up-to-date with our habits and best-practices. It allow you to bootstrap an app from scratch in a breeze.


Use it
------

### Step 1: clone the app

```sh
$ git clone \
  --origin=template \
  --depth=1 \
  https://github.com/cozy/cozy-template.git \
  my-app
```

### Step 2: customize templates resources

The [`my-app/.templates`](.templates) dir contains some templates you can use in your final repository. You should copy them to the root of your project (excepted the `.transifexrc` file). Be careful that those files contains some _vars_ you must replace to have the files fully functional:

- `<APP_NAME>`: the application name
- `<APP_SHORT_DESCRIPTION>`: a quick app description
- `<APP_CATEGORY>`: the app category (used in the cozy-bar apps navigation)
- `<APP_MAINTAINER>`: Github main maintainer username (don't forget `@` :))
- `<SLUG_TX>`: transifex app slug
- `<SLUG_GH>`: Github repository slug
- `<SLUG_NPM>`: NPM slug
- `<USERNAME_GH>`: Github username

Don't forget to update your LICENSE too if needed.

:warning: Concerning the application category, for now just `cozy` and `partners` are handled. Other categories will be handled soon, for now, you can let this field blank, it will be in the `others` category. If a category is empty, missing or not recognized, it will be `others` by default.

### Step 3: add your own repository

Go to https://github.com/new and create a new repository for your app. Then add it to your app:

```sh
$ git remote add \
  origin \
  https://github.com/<USERNAME_GH>/<SLUG_GH>.git
$ git commit -am "Initial commit for my-app"
$ git push -u origin master:master
```

### That's it :rocket:!

Congrats! Your app is now fully set. You can start coding in [`src`](src), and run it through a [cozy-stack](https://cozy.github.io/cozy-stack/).
